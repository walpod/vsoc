	<a name="desc">Description</a>
</h1>
<p>
	To understand Atan it is necessary that you
	understand the basics of <a href="index.html#links">Soccer-Server</a> first.
	The following picture gives you a rough overview of Soccer-Server and
	some of the objects it uses.
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
	Soccer-Server players communicate via a UDP-Connection
	with external programs that control the player
	in a way that they play soccer. These external programs
	communicate with Soccer-Server using interface strings described
	in the <a href="index.html#links">Soccer-Server manual</a>.
</p>
<p align="center">
	<a href="pic2.png"><img src="pic2tn.png" border="0" align="center"></a>
</p>
<p>
	Atan is a program that helps you to write such external programs.
	You dont have to worry about how to establishe a UDP connection,
	how command strings can be parsed to get information from Soccer-Server,
	and how to generate command strings in order to control the corresponding player.
	Finally you dont have to take care of the side you are currently playing.
	All information coming from Atan are relative to you own side. That means
	you dont see a left- or right goal but rather you see a own- or an other
	goal. Or you dont see top- or bottom flags but left- or right flags
	depending on what side you are currently playing.
	To use Atan all you have to do is to implement the
	<a href="javadoc/atan/model/Controller.html">atan.model.Controller</a>
	interface and use the <a href="javadoc/atan/model/Player.html">atan.model.Player</a>
        interface.
</p>
<p align="center">
	<a href="pic3.png"><img src="pic3tn.png" border="0" align="center"></a>
</p>
<p>
	The task of your implementation of the Controller interface
 	(Your-Controller) is to receive information from Soccer-Server, to
	interprete this information and to control the associated player by using
	a set of control commands. It receives information from a number of hook
	methods that are called in regular intervalls (info cycles). These methods include all
	the keywords inform or info, like preInform(), postInform(), infoSeeFlag(),
	infoSeeLine(), infoHear() and so on.
	At the beginning of every info cycle the method preInform() is calld. This gives
	you the possibillity to reset the inner state of your controller.
	Then the info...() methods are called according to what info is currently
	avaylable. E.g. if a certain flag is currently visible the infoSeeFlag...()
	method that belongs to that flag is called. The arguments of the method spezify
	what flag was exactly ment (id), in what direction the flag was seen relative
	to the direction the player is currently looking (direction) and the distance
	between the player and the flag. The following graphic should give you an idea
	how the info methods are connected to the objects of Soccer-Server. <br>

	<a href="pic4.png"><img src="pic4tn.png" border="0" align="center"></a>
</p>
<p>
	At the end of every info cycle the method postInform() is called. Your
	controller should now decide what control commands it sends to the player.
	The control commands are available by the
        <a href="javadoc/atan/model/Player.html">atan.model.Player</a> interface that
	is known by every Controler (see getPlayer()). Calling one of these methods
	will cause the associated player of Soccer-Server to react in the right way.
	E.g. if a Controller calls getPlayer().dash(10) the player will be acellerated
	with the power of 10. Details about the meaning of diffrent parameters like
	power or distance can be found in the Soccer-Server manual.
	If you have implemented your controller you can easily start it by creating
	an instance of
        <a href="javadoc/atan/model/SServerPlayer.html">atan.model.SServerPlayer</a>.
        SServerPlayer is an implementation of Player.
        Its constructor needs your implementation of Controller as argument.
	If you call the connect() method of SServerPlayer it connects to Soccer-Server
	and starts calling your controllers info methods every 150 ms
        (According to the parameters of Soccer-Servera). In that time your controller
	should have finished the decition process of how to react to the information he got and
        the control methods should be called.
	To simplify the process of creating instances of SServerPlayer the absract class
	<a href="javadoc/atan/model/Team.html">atan.model.Team</a> with a GUI (TeamFrame(to javadoc)) is offerd by Atan. See the
	sample implementation how to use Team and TeamFrame.
	If you did not understand every detail of this description dont worry. Try to
 	implement your own controller, look at the sample implementation  and you
	well soon have some results. Hopefully no frustration.

  </h1>
  <p>
    The sample implementation includes two controller and a team. The controllers
    are Sample and Silly.
    They are both not implemented to play soccer, but should rather illustrate how
    to implement a certain behaviour using the Atan interface. It is up to you
    developing real soccer playing controllers.<br>
    Simple has the behaviour to run towards the ball if it sees it. Is the ball
    within the kick area (distance smaller 0.7) of the player it is kicked in a randon
    direction. If it sees the own goal and it is not too far away it is heading
    towards the goal ignoring the ball. Does it see nothing because it is out
    of the soccer field it turns 180 deg. If the controller sees any object but
    the ball or the own goal it is slowly looking around, searching the ball
    or the own goal. Is the player in the "before kick off" mode it is moved
    to a certain position in its own half according to the unique number.
    The Silly controller implements the following behaviour. It is always running
    streight ahead. If it sees a line not far away it turns 90 deg to the left.
    It does not care about anything but lines. Really silly.<br>
